# Project-for-Evacuated-U-tube-solar-collector
ML tools application in Evacuated U-tube solar collector. It is a All in one ML tools Python and sklearn project for Evacuated U-tube solar collector. The link for the paper can be found [here](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/solarenergyengineering/article-abstract/doi/10.1115/1.4054852/1141712/Design-and-Performance-Analyses-of-Evacuated-U?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

To run any algorithm, run command line code in the following way: For example linear regression with test size of 5

```
python main.py -m 'lr' -t 5
```

For calculating the permutation feature importance for different outputs, do the following: For example for temperature

```
python feature_importance.py -o 'temperature'
```
